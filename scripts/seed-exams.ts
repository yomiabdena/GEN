    title: 'Computer Science: Algorithms & Data Structures',
    subject: 'Computer Science',
    description: 'Fundamental algorithmic analysis, sorting complexities, binary heaps, and graph traversals.',
    difficulty: 'medium' as const,
    authorDisplayName: 'CodeMaster #482a',
    tags: ['Algorithms', 'DataStructures', 'BigO'],
    questions: [
       {
        order: 1,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'What is the worst-case time complexity of QuickSort when the first element is always chosen as the pivot on an already sorted array?',
        options: ['O(n log n)', 'O(n)', 'O(n²)', 'O(log n)'],
        correctAnswer: 'O(n²)',
        explanation: 'Selecting the first element as the pivot on sorted input creates partitions of size 0 and n-1, resulting in quadratic O(n²) performance.',
      },
      {
        order: 2,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'Which data structure is essential for implementing Breadth-First Search (BFS) in a graph?',
        options: ['Stack', 'Queue', 'Min-Heap', 'Disjoint Set'],
        correctAnswer: 'Queue',
        explanation: 'BFS processes vertices in FIFO order, making a Queue the core data structure for traversing the graph level by level.',
      },
      {
        order: 3,
        type: 'true-false' as const,
        question: 'In an AVL tree, the height difference between the left and right subtree of any node can never be greater than 1.',
        options: ['True', 'False'],
        correctAnswer: 'True',
        explanation: 'AVL trees maintain a balance factor of -1, 0, or 1 for every node to ensure the tree remains height-balanced.',
      },
      {
        order: 4,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'What is the space complexity of Depth-First Search (DFS) when performed on a balanced binary tree containing N nodes?',
        options: ['O(N)', 'O(log N)', 'O(1)', 'O(N²)'],
        correctAnswer: 'O(log N)',
        explanation: 'In a balanced binary tree, DFS only stores nodes along the current path, so the maximum stack depth is O(log N).',
      },
      {
        order: 5,
        type: 'short-answer' as const,
        question: 'Which algorithmic paradigm does Dijkstra’s algorithm use to compute shortest paths in a graph with non-negative edge weights?',
        options: null,
        correctAnswer: 'Greedy',
        explanation: 'Dijkstra’s algorithm follows a greedy strategy by repeatedly choosing the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance.',

    title: 'Mathematics: Differential Calculus & Limits',
    subject: 'Mathematics',
    description: 'Derivative rules, L Hôpital limit evaluations, continuity, and critical value optimization.',
    difficulty: 'hard' as const,
    authorDisplayName: 'MathWhiz #9c1f',
    tags: ['Calculus', 'Limits', 'Derivatives'],
    questions: [
      {
        order: 1,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'What is the derivative of f(x) = ln(3x² + 1) with respect to x?',
        options: ['6x / (3x² + 1)', '1 / (3x² + 1)', '6x ln(3x² + 1)', '3x / (3x² + 1)'],
        correctAnswer: '6x / (3x² + 1)',
        explanation: 'By the chain rule, d/dx[ln(u)] = (1/u) * u\'. Here u = 3x² + 1 and u\' = 6x, so the derivative is 6x / (3x² + 1).',
      },
      {
        order: 2,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'Evaluate the limit: lim (x -> 0) [sin(5x) / x].',
        options: ['0', '1', '5', 'Does not exist'],
        correctAnswer: '5',
        explanation: 'Using the fundamental trigonometric limit lim (u -> 0) [sin(u)/u] = 1, rewrite as 5 * lim (x -> 0) [sin(5x) / (5x)] = 5 * 1 = 5.',
      },
      {
        order: 3,
        type: 'true-false' as const,
        question: 'If a function f(x) is continuous at x = c, then f(x) is guaranteed to be differentiable at x = c.',
        options: ['True', 'False'],
        correctAnswer: 'False',
        explanation: 'Continuity does not imply differentiability. The classic counterexample is f(x) = |x| at x = 0, which is continuous but has a sharp corner (no unique tangent line).',
      },
    ],

  {
    title: 'Biology: Cellular Respiration & ATP Synthesis',
    subject: 'Biology',
    description: 'Glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial ATP synthase.',
    difficulty: 'easy' as const,
    authorDisplayName: 'BioPro #3d88',
    tags: ['CellBiology', 'Respiration', 'Mitochondria'],
    questions: [
      {
        order: 1,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'In eukaryotic cells, where does glycolysis take place?',
        options: ['Mitochondrial matrix', 'Cytoplasm', 'Inner mitochondrial membrane', 'Nucleus'],
        correctAnswer: 'Cytoplasm',
        explanation: 'Glycolysis is the universal initial pathway of glucose breakdown and takes place entirely in the cytosol / cytoplasm.',
      },
      {
        order: 2,
        type: 'multiple-choice' as const,
        question: 'Which organelle is widely referred to as the powerhouse of the cell due to producing the majority of cellular ATP?',
        options: ['Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Mitochondria', 'Lysosome'],
        correctAnswer: 'Mitochondria',
        explanation: 'Mitochondria perform the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, generating the bulk of the cell ATP.',
      },
      {
        order: 3,
        type: 'true-false' as const,
        question: 'Anaerobic fermentation yields significantly more ATP molecules per glucose molecule than aerobic cellular respiration.',
        options: ['True', 'False'],
        correctAnswer: 'False',
        explanation: 'Fermentation produces only 2 net ATP per glucose (from glycolysis), whereas aerobic cellular respiration produces approximately 30-32 ATP.',
      },
